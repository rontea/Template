<p>”Ra is committed to delivering convenient and accessible products for managing C5-mediated diseases. Building on the strength of our daily formulation, which offers a quick, low volume injection and room temperature storage, the FluidCrystal® extended release (XR) formulation of zilucoplan has the potential to control disease for at least seven days from a single subcutaneous dose without the need for intravenous loading, on-body infusion devices, tissue-degrading enzymes, or permeation enhancers. The promising data from our pre-clinical studies conducted with 
  <org>Camurus</org>, the potential for cost-effective manufacturing, and Camurus’s proven late-stage regulatory experience with FluidCrystal® were compelling reasons to add the FluidCrystal® technology into our zilucoplan XR life-cycle extension program,” said <person>Doug Treco</person>, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Ra Pharma.</p>

<p>In pre-clinical testing, a single dose of the FC XR formulation of zilucoplan in non-human primates rapidly achieved and maintained target levels of complement inhibition for at least seven days without the need for an intravenous loading regimen (see Figure 1 below).</p>

<p>“The partnership with Ra Pharma follows the successful completion of a feasibility study of the FluidCrystal® extended release zilucoplan injection, which met formulation, pharmacokinetic, and tolerability target specifications,” said <person>Fredrik Tiberg</person>, President &amp; CEO of <org>Camurus</org>. “We look forward to the next phase of our collaboration with Ra Pharma and initiating clinical development of a new promising product candidate based on our unique FluidCrystal® technology.”</p>

<p>Under the agreement, <org>Camurus</org> will receive an upfront payment of <money>$2 million</money> and is eligible to receive up to <money>$14.5 million</money> in development milestones and other license payments, up to <money>$55 million</money> in sales milestones, and tiered single digit royalty payments on product sales related to the FC XR formulation of zilucoplan.</p>

<p>Ra Pharma is developing zilucoplan and zilucoplan extended release (XR) for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and other tissue-based, complement-mediated disorders with high unmet medical need. The product candidates are designed for convenient subcutaneous (SC) self-administration. Zilucoplan is an investigational, synthetic, macrocyclic peptide discovered using Ra Pharma's powerful proprietary drug discovery technology. The peptide is designed to bind complement component 5 (C5) with sub-nanomolar affinity and allosterically inhibit its cleavage into C5a and C5b upon activation of the classical, alternative, or lectin pathways.</p>
